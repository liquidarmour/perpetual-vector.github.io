*‚ÄúSoftware is a team sport ‚Äî my role is to create the conditions for teams to deliver, learn, and thrive.‚Äù*

# **PROFILE**

Engineering leader with 20+ years in software delivery, known for turning struggling teams into high-performers and driving sustainable, predictable delivery. Believes ‚Äúsoftware is a team sport‚Äù and has consistently built high-trust, high-output teams that deliver business value at pace. Combines deep technical expertise in microservices, event-driven systems, and cloud platforms with a pragmatic, people-first leadership style. Skilled at aligning engineering delivery with organisational goals, rebuilding confidence in teams, and embedding CI/CD and DevOps practices that stick.

Whether it‚Äôs stabilising a legacy release pipeline, leading large-scale migrations, or aligning engineering output with business priorities, my approach is consistent: cut through complexity, focus on outcomes, and build a culture where delivery is a given, not a gamble.
