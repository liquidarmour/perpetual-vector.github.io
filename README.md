## Profile
I‚Äôm a delivery-driven engineering leader with 20+ years of experience building and scaling high-performing teams that deliver software users trust. My career has spanned hands-on coding, technical leadership, and engineering management ‚Äî always with a focus on enabling value flow from idea to production.

I combine deep technical expertise in microservices, messaging systems, and cloud infrastructure with proven people leadership. My hallmark is turning underperforming or stalled teams into predictable, confident delivery units by embedding sustainable practices such as CI/CD, DevOps culture, and iterative delivery.

Whether it‚Äôs stabilising a legacy release pipeline, leading large-scale migrations, or aligning engineering output with business priorities, my approach is consistent: cut through complexity, focus on outcomes, and build a culture where delivery is a given, not a gamble.
